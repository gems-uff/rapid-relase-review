# Rapid Release Systematic Literature Review

We conducted a systematic literature review to identify and compare the primary
works that study rapid release with traditional releases. A systematic
literature review is a secondary study to identify, evaluate, and interpret all
available research about a particular research question, topic, or phenomenon
[^Kitchenham2007]. According to Kitchenham[^Kitchenham2009], the systematic
literature review differs from other regular \textit{ad hoc} literature reviews
because it comprises a methodologically rigorous process to aggregate all the
existing evidence on a research topic and intends to support the development of
evidence-based analysis. 

We ran the systematic literature review through snowballing [^Wohlin2014]. In
snowballing, we first selected a start set of relevant works. Then, we
discovered other relevant work by analyzing the papers they cited (i.e.,
backward snowballing) and those that cited them (i.e., forward snowballing). We
repeated this process to increase the coverage of our systematic literature
review and achieve a higher recall \citep{Mourao2020}.

This replication package includes the BibTex files we used to organize and track
the snowballing process, including the papers that were excluded from our
systematic literature review. The replication package also contains a summary of
selected papers that compose our systematic literature review.

## Instructions

Use [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/) to open the `rapid-release-review.bib`. The tool enables navigating through the steps of the systematic review. We categorized the papers found in each forward and backward snowballing.
