# RQ1. What characterizes a rapid release cycle?

Firefox, six-weeks.

# RQ2. What are the implications of adopting a rapid release cycle?

The integration of 34% to 60% of addressed issues in the studied systems with
traditional release cycles (ArgoUML and Eclipse) was delayed by at least one
release, despite being addressed well before of the official release date.
Furthermore, 98% of the addressed issues were delayed by at least one release in
the rapidly released Firefox system.

Addressed issues are usually delayed in a rapid release cycle.

# RQ3. What metrics do the studies use to compare rapid and traditional releases?

delay between when an issue is addressed and when it is integrated

# RQ4. How do the studies mine release information?

Release notes from the projects.
Issue tracking system

# RQ5. How do the studies evaluate their findings?

None.

# RQ6. What corpus do the studies use to compare rapid and traditional releases?

20,995 issues collected from the ArgoUML, Eclipse, and Firefox projects
Compared ArgoUML and Eclipse with Firefox
