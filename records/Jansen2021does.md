# RQ1. What characterizes a rapid release cycle?

35 days.

# RQ2. What are the implications of adopting a rapid release cycle?

This suggests that the duration of fast release cycles does not seem to impact
bug handling activity.

# RQ3. What metrics do the studies use to compare rapid and traditional releases?

Bug fixing 
Bug triaging
Bug survival

# RQ4. How do the studies mine release information?

RapidRelease dataset
GitHub API 

# RQ5. How do the studies evaluate their findings?

Gandhi-Washington Method

# RQ6. What corpus do the studies use to compare rapid and traditional releases?

420 open source projects with rapid release cycles from RapidRelease dataset
