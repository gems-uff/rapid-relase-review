# RQ1. What characterizes a rapid release cycle?

30 days.

# RQ2. What are the implications of adopting a rapid release cycle?

Only 13% of the projects can be categorized as rapid. It did not observe
significant release cycle differences among different topics.

It does not separate releases and patches.

# RQ3. What metrics do the studies use to compare rapid and traditional releases?

Release date and Release cycle

# RQ4. How do the studies mine release information?

World of Code (WoC) dataset.
GitHub API to extract releases.

# RQ5. How do the studies evaluate their findings?

Non-parametric tests: Kruskal-Wallis, Fisherâ€™s Exact Test 

# RQ6. What corpus do the studies use to compare rapid and traditional releases?

74,658 releases from 4,101 GitHub projects from four four popular programming languages; Go, Java,
Python, and Ruby.
