# RQ1. What characterizes a rapid release cycle?

  - The authors use Firefox rapid release cycle, which comprises a release every six weeks.

# RQ2. What are the implications of adopting a rapid release cycle?

  - The adoption of the rapid release cycle has a significantly negative effect on the applications size change.

  - The adoption of the rapid release cycle does not effect the application responsiveness.

# RQ3. What metrics do the studies use to compare rapid and traditional releases?

  - Application responsiveness (the number of weeks between the release of the platform and the application release√ß and
  - Application change size (the rate of file size change between two successive application releases).

# RQ4. How do the studies mine release information?

The authors mined information about third-party apps from the official website for Firefox apps (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox) as well as platform releases (e.g., release date and notes) from the official website for Firefox
(https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/releases/).

# RQ5. How do the studies evaluate their findings?

The authors conducted correlation tests to compare the metrics in traditional and rapid release cycles.

# RQ6. What corpus do the studies use to compare rapid and traditional releases?

  - 1,042 Firefox applications and extensions, observed in 105 weeks from June 2009 to August 2013, since Firefox 5.
