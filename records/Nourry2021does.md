# RQ1. What characterizes a rapid release cycle?

12 weeks (1 quartely)

# RQ2. What are the implications of adopting a rapid release cycle?

Weekly efforts dedicated to refactoring activities was lower across all projects
after shortening the release cycles.

A decreased amount of refactoring and refactoring activities on one project (JDT
core) and nothing with otehr projects when adopting rapid releases.

A reduce of the refactoring churn in two projects when adopting rapid releases,
but only one is significant.

The same refactoring patterns are common both in rapid and tradicional releases.

Developers do not apply complex refactorings as much during the shorter
releases in one project.

No clear impacts of adopting shorter releases on the number of developers that
refactor

The refactoring workload is more evenly distributed among developers that
refactor during the shorter releases. 

# RQ3. What metrics do the studies use to compare rapid and traditional releases?

amount of refactoring
efforts devoted to refactoring
type of refactoring 
human resources dedicated to refactoring

# RQ4. How do the studies mine release information?

GitHub repositories

# RQ5. How do the studies evaluate their findings?

Mann–Whitney test for statistical tests
Cliff’s delta for effect size

# RQ6. What corpus do the studies use to compare rapid and traditional releases?

3 software projects from eclipses.
