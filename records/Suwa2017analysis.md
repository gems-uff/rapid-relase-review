# RQ1. What characterizes a rapid release cycle?

The authors do not define rapid release cycle.

# RQ2. What are the implications of adopting a rapid release cycle?

Libraries with short-release cycles have higher rollback rates than those with
long release cycles

# RQ3. What metrics do the studies use to compare rapid and traditional releases?

Release version on client application.

# RQ4. How do the studies mine release information?

Selected projects from github repos of BigQuery
Java POM to detect dependencies

# RQ5. How do the studies evaluate their findings?

Statistical tests

# RQ6. What corpus do the studies use to compare rapid and traditional releases?

50 libraries used in 2,186 projects
