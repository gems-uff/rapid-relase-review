# RQ1. What characterizes a rapid release cycle?

Firefox 6 weeks release cycle.

# RQ2. What are the implications of adopting a rapid release cycle?

Patches equal bugfixes on the context of the paper.

While the results report some differences in the proportion of patches on each
transition of the model in pre- and post-rapid release, the patch lifecycle
appears not to have changed much.

The results show that pre and post-rapid release bugs have a similar
distribution of the resubmitted patches.

Patches from casual contributors are more likely to be abandoned by both
reviewers and contributors themselves.

Patches from casual developers are accepted faster, they are more likely to be
approved within first hour (26% vs. 23%).

Patches from core contributors are rejected faster, around 20% of these patches
are rejected within first hour of their submission.

On average, the lifespan of a pre-rapid release patch is 4.6 days, while the
lifespans of post-rapid release patches are 2.8 days and 3.4 days for core and
casual developers.

On average, the lifespan of a pre-rapid release patch is 4.6 days, while the
lifespans of post-rapid release patches are 2.8 days and 3.4 days for core and
casual developers.

# RQ3. What metrics do the studies use to compare rapid and traditional releases?

Casual and core contributors
Patches and its lifecycle
Patches review and its states timestamps

# RQ4. How do the studies mine release information?

Bugzilla.

# RQ5. How do the studies evaluate their findings?

Interviews and discussions with developers.

# RQ6. What corpus do the studies use to compare rapid and traditional releases?

Patches from Firefox:
 - pre-rapid release span: 2010-04-12 to 2011-04-12
 - post-rapid release span: 2011-04-12 to 2012-04-12
