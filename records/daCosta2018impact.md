# RQ1. What characterizes a rapid release cycle?

The authors use Firefox rapid release cycle, which comprises a release every six weeks.

# RQ2. What are the implications of adopting a rapid release cycle?

The paper reinforces the discovered found by the authors' previous paper and includes a qualitative study.

  - The integration rate of fixed issues is more consistent in rapid releases than in traditional releases.

  - Traditional releases prioritize the integration of backlog issues, while rapid releases prioritize integrating issues of the current release cycle.

Also, the paper complements their previous findings:

  The integration of fixed issues is delayed due to reasons associated with the development activities, decision-making, team collaboration, or risk. Moreover, integration delays lead to user/developer frustration.

  - The promise of delivering fixed issues more quickly is the most recurrent motivator to switch to a rapid release cycle. In addition, the promise of improving management flexibility and the quality of fixed issues are other perceived advantages of switching to rapid release cycles.

  - The integration rush is no longer needed in rapid releases, and additional time can be spent on polishing fixed issues.

# RQ3. What metrics do the studies use to compare rapid and traditional releases?

The same metrics of the previous paper, plus:

# RQ4. How do the studies mine release information?

The same approach of previous paper to the quantitative study and Grounded
Theory to the qualitative study. Also, the authors used a quantitative analysis with statistical tests considering the responses to Likert-scale questions of their questionnaire.

# RQ5. How do the studies evaluate their findings?

The same approach of the previous paper, plus the authored conducted a survey with 37 developers from the Firefox, Eclipse, and ArgoUML projects to study the perceived impact of integration delay and the shift from a traditional to a rapid release cycle.

# RQ6. What corpus do the studies use to compare rapid and traditional releases?

The same corpus of the previous paper, plus the authors conducted a survey with 37 developers from the Firefox, Eclipse, and ArgoUML projects to study the perceived impact of integration delay and the shift from a traditional to a rapid release cycle.
