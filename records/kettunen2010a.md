# RQ1. What characterizes a rapid release cycle?

The authors do not define a rapid release cycle but work with agile concepts.

# RQ2. What are the implications of adopting a rapid release cycle?

  1. In the rapid release cycle, the implementation of the most critical parts of the software comes first, which allows testing to start early and focus on the critical parts first. However, developers need to reserve more time for testing.

  2. The tester is more efficient in rapid release cycle because they do not have to change across different parts of the project. 
   
  3. Acceptance tests can be more efficient in the rapid release cycle because when delivered in pieces, testing a part of the software is faster than testing the whole software at once. 


# RQ3. What metrics do the studies use to compare rapid and traditional releases?

Not applicable.

# RQ4. How do the studies mine release information?

Not applicable.

# RQ5. How do the studies evaluate their findings?

we decided to
interview several people from the organization during three
interview rounds, 

The authors conducted three interview rounds and used the ground theory method.

# RQ6. What corpus do the studies use to compare rapid and traditional releases?

The authors interviewed software designers, test managers, and testers from twelve organization units (varied from small, national companies to large international software producers).
