# RQ1. What characterizes a rapid release cycle?

The authors used the mean of the distribution of release frequencies of the projects in ING, a large multinational financial organization with about 54,000 employees and over 37 million customers. They consider 3.56 weeks a rapid release.

# RQ2. What are the implications of adopting a rapid release cycle?

 1. The teams that adopt rapid release cycle are always more delayed than their traditional counterparts;
 
 2. The dependencies and infrastructure are the most common factors that are perceived to cause delay in rapid teams.

 3. The majority of developers perceive that the small changes in code and rapid feedback improve software quality.
 
 4. The developers reported to experience an increased deadline pressure in rapid release, which negatively affects the code quality, leads to an increase in workarounds and poor implementation choices. They also reported that rapid release cut the overall time spent on refactoring and regression testing.

# RQ3. What metrics do the studies use to compare rapid and traditional releases?

 - SonarQube measurements of releases

# RQ4. How do the studies mine release information?


# RQ5. How do the studies evaluate their findings?

The authors conducted a mixed-methods study, consisting of a survey with
461 engineers, and a statistical analysis of 2 years (2016-2018) of code quality data for 611 teams.

# RQ6. What corpus do the studies use to compare rapid and traditional releases?

  - Survey with 461 engineers from ING;
  - 2 years of code quality data for 611 teams from ING.
  - Major releases of 3048 software projects.
