# RQ1. What characterizes a rapid release cycle?

The authors use Firefox rapid release cycle, which comprises a release every six weeks.

# RQ2. What are the implications of adopting a rapid release cycle?

  1. The transition from the traditional to the rapid releasy cycle tends to focus the developers' time on maintaining the code, i.e., it increases the time working in bug fixing activities.

  2. The authors observed less re-engineering activities had been performed in the rapid release cycle.

  3. The total amount of work put in the same period is similar to the traditional and rapid release cycle.

# RQ3. What metrics do the studies use to compare rapid and traditional releases?

  - Number of methods of interest; and
  - Total number of lines of code.

# RQ4. How do the studies mine release information?

The authors did not describe their mine process.

# RQ5. How do the studies evaluate their findings?

The author conducted an exploratory study.

# RQ6. What corpus do the studies use to compare rapid and traditional releases?
