The strategy of the release processes and practices can impact the quality of a software artefact. Although such impact has been extensively discussed and studied in the software engineering community, there are still many pending issues to resolve. The goal of this thesis is to study and solve some of these pending issues. More specifically, we examine 1) why code review practices can miss crash-prone code; 2) how urgent patches (also called patch uplift) are approved to release and how to prevent regressions due to urgent patches; 3) in a software ecosystem, how to mitigate the risk of defects due to DLL injections. We chose to study these problems because they correspond to three important phases of software release processes, i.e., code review, patch uplift, and releasing software in an ecosystem. The solutions of these problems can help software organizations improve their release strategy; increasing their development productivity and the overall user-perceived quality of their products.},

  abstract  = {In rapid release development processes, patches that fix critical issues, or implement high-value features are often promoted directly from the development channel to a stabilization channel, potentially skipping one or more stabilization channels. This practice is called patch uplift. Patch uplift is risky, because patches that are rushed through the stabilization phase can end up introducing regressions in the code. This paper examines patch uplift operations at Mozilla, with the aim to identify the characteristics of the uplifted patches that did not effectively fix the targeted problem and that introduced regressions. Through statistical and manual analyses, a series of problems were investigated, including the reasons behind patch uplift decisions, the root causes of ineffective uplifts, the characteristics of uplifted patches that introduced regressions, and whether these regressions can be prevented. Additionally, three Mozilla release managers were interviewed in order to understand organizational factors that affect patch uplift decisions and outcomes. Results show that most patches are uplifted because of a wrong functionality or a crash. Certain uplifts did not effectively address their problems because they did not completely fix the problems or lead to regressions. Uplifted patches that lead to regressions tend to have larger patch size, and most of the faults are due to semantic or memory errors in the patches. Also, release managers are more inclined to accept patch uplift requests that concern certain specific components, and\textendash or that are submitted by certain specific developers. About 25\% to 30\% of the regressions due to Beta or Release uplifts could have been prevented as they could be reproduced by developers and were found in widely used feature/website/configuration or via telemetry.},

This paper is a preliminary step toward an analysis of the work patterns and possible indicators of overload and time pressure on software developers with mining software repositories approach. We explore the working pattern of developers in the context of Mozilla Firefox, a large and long-lived open source project. To that end we investigate the impact of the move from traditional to rapid release cycle on work pattern. Moreover we compare Mozilla Firefox work pattern with another Mozilla product, Firefox OS, which has a different release cycle than Firefox. We find that both projects exhibit healthy working patterns, i.e. lower activity during the weekends and outside of office hours. Firefox experiences proportionally more activity on weekends than Firefox OS (Cohen's d = 0.94). We find that switching to rapid releases has reduced weekend work (Cohen's d = 1.43) and working during the night (Cohen's d = 0.45). This result holds even when we limit the analyzes on the hired resources, i.e. considering only individuals with Mozilla foundation email address, although, the effect sizes are smaller for weekends (Cohen's d = 0.64) and nights (Cohen's d = 0.23). Moreover, we use dissimilarity word clouds and find that work during the weekend is more technical while work during the week expresses more positive sentiment with words like "good" and "nice". Our results suggest that moving to rapid releases have positive impact on the work health and work-life-balance of software engineers. However, caution is needed as our results are based on a limited set of quantitative data from a single organization.},

To inform future approaches for automatic stress and overload detection, this paper establishes empirically collected measures of the work patterns of software engineers. To this aim, we perform the first large-scale study of software engineers' working hours by investigating the time stamps of commit activities of 86 large open source software projects, both containing hired and volunteer developers. We find that two thirds of software engineers mainly follow typical office hours, empirically established to be from 10h to 18h, and do not usually work during nights and weekends. Large variations between projects and individuals exist. Surprisingly, we found no support that project maturation would decrease abnormal working hours. In the Firefox case study, we found that hired developers work more during office hours while seniority, either in terms of number of commits or job status, did not impact working hours. We conclude that the use of working hours or timestamps of work products for stress detection requires establishing baselines at the level of individuals.},

During each release, new bugs are reported, triaged and resolved. Previous studies have focused on various aspects of bug fixing, such as bug triaging, bug prediction, and bug process analysis. Most studies, however, do not distinguish between what happens before and after each scheduled release. We are also unaware of studies that compare bug fixing activities across different project releases. This paper presents an empirical analysis of the bug handling process of Eclipse over a 15-year period, considering 138K bug reports from Bugzilla, including 16 annual Eclipse releases and two quarterly releases in 2018. We compare the bug resolution rate, the fixing rate, the bug triaging time and the fixing time before and after each release date, and we study the possible impact of "release pressure". Among others, our results reveal that Eclipse bug handling activity is improving over time, with an important decrease in the number of reported bugs before releases, an increase in the bug fixing rate and an increasingly balanced bug handling workload before and after releases. The recent transition from an annual to a quarterly release cycle continued to improve the bug handling process.},

  abstract   = {Developing a successful game is challenging. Prior work shows that gamers are extremely difficult to satisfy, making the quality of games an important issue. Prior work has yielded important results from mining data that is available on the online distribution platforms for software applications, helping practitioners save valuable resources, and improving the user-perceived quality of software that is distributed through these platforms. However, much of the work on mining online distribution platforms focuses on mining mobile app stores (e.g., Google Play Store, Apple App Store). Video game development differs from the development of other types of software. Hence, knowledge derived from mining mobile app stores may not be directly applicable to game development.    In this Ph.D. thesis, we focused on mining online distribution platforms for games. In particular, we mined data from the Steam platform, the largest digital distribution platforms for PC gaming, with over 23,000 games available and over 184 million active users. More specifically, we analyzed the following four aspects of online distribution for games: urgent updates; the early access model (which enables game developers to sell unfinished versions of their games); user reviews; and user-recorded gameplay videos on the Steam platform. We observed that the choice of update strategy is associated with the proportion of urgent updates that developers have to release. Early access game developers can use the early access model as a method for eliciting early feedback and more positive reviews to attract additional new players. In addition, although negative reviews contain more valuable information for developers, the portion of useful information in positive reviews should not be ignored by developers and researchers. Finally, we proposed an approach for determining the likelihood that a gameplay video demonstrates a game bug, with both a mean average precision at 10 and a mean average precision at 100 of 0.91. Our approach can help game developers leverage readily available gameplay videos to automatically collect otherwise hard-to-gather bug reports for games. The results of our empirical studies highlight the value of mining online distribution platforms for games in offering practical suggestions for game developers.},

  title     = {Release Management in Free and Open Source Software Ecosystems},
  year      = {2016},
  type      = {Thesis},
  abstract  = {Releasing software is challenging. To decide when to release software, developers may  consider a deadline, a set of features or quality attributes. Yet, there are many stories of  software that is not released on time. In large-scale software development, release management  requires significant communication and coordination. It is particularly challenging  in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) ecosystems, in which hundreds of loosely connected  developers and their projects are coordinated for releasing software according to a  schedule.  In this work, we investigate the release management process in two large-scale FOSS  development projects. In particular, our focus is the communication in the whole release  management process in each ecosystem across multiple releases. The main research questions  addressed in this dissertation are: (1) How do developers in these FOSS ecosystems  communicate and coordinate to build and release a common product based on different  projects? (2) What are the release management tasks in a FOSS ecosystem? and (3) What  are the challenges that release managers face in a FOSS ecosystem?  To understand this process and its challenges better, we used a multiple case study  methodology, and colleced evidence from a combination of the following sources: documents,  archival records, interviews, direct observation, participant observation, and physical  artifacts. We conducted the case studies on two FLOSS software ecosystems: GNOME  and OpenStack. We analyzed over two and half years of communication in each ecosystem  and studied developers' interactions. GNOME is a collection of libraries, system services,  and end-user applications; together, these projects provide a unified desktop \textemdash the GNOME  desktop. OpenStack is a collection of software tools for building and managing cloud computing  platforms for public and private clouds. We catalogued communication channels,  categorized coordination activities in one channel, and triangulated our results by  interviewing key developers identified through social network analysis.  We found factors that impact the release process in a software ecosystem, including a  release schedule positively, influence instead of direct control, and diversity. The release  schedule drives most of the communication within an ecosystem. To achieve a concerted release,  a Release Team helps developers reach technical consensus through influence rather  than direct control. The diverse composition of the Release Team might increase its reach  and influence in the ecosystem. Our results can help organizations build better large-scale  teams and show that software engineering research focused on individual projects might  miss important parts of the picture.  The contributions of this dissertation are: (1) an empirical study of release management  in two FOSS ecosystems (2) a set of lessons learned from the case studies, and (3) a theory  of release management in FOSS ecosystems. We summarize our theory that explains our  understanding of release management in FOSS ecosystems as three statements: (1) the size  and complexity of the integrated product is constrained by the release managers capacity,  (2) release management should be capable of reaching the whole ecosystem, and (3) the  release managers need social and technical skills. The dissertation discusses this theory in  the light of the case studies, other research efforts, and its implications.},

However, developers at major companies, such as Google and Facebook, commit all changes to a single branch. They isolate unrelated changes using feature-flags, which allows them to disable works in progress. My goal is to empirically determine the best practices when using flags and identify dead code.

  abstract   = {Continuous Integration (CI) is a software engineering practice where developers constantly integrate their changes to a project through an automated build process. The goal of CI is to provide developers with prompt feedback on several quality dimensions after each change. Indeed, previous studies provided empirical evidence on a positive association between properly following CI principles and source code quality. A core principle behind CI is Continuous Code Quality (also known as CCQ, which includes automated testing and automated code inspection) may appear simple and effective, yet we know little about its practical adoption. In this paper, we propose a preliminary empirical investigation aimed at understanding how rigorously practitioners follow CCQ. Our study reveals a strong dichotomy between theory and practice: developers do not perform continuous inspection but rather control for quality only at the end of a sprint and most of the times only on the release branch.

Despite its undisputed benefits, like higher software quality and improved developer productivity, mastering CI is not easy. Among the several barriers when transitioning to CI, developers need to face a new type of software failures (i.e., build failures) that requires them to understand complex build logs. Even when a team has successfully introduced a CI culture, living up to its principles and improving the CI practice are also challenging. In my research, I want to provide developers with the right support for establishing CI and the proper recommendations for continuously improving their CI process.},

For the survival of OSS projects, the projects need to not only retain existing developers, but also attract new developers to grow. To better understand how projects retain and attract contributors, our preliminary study aimed to measure the personnel attraction and retention of OSS projects using a pair of population migration metrics, called Magnet (personnel attraction) and Sticky (retention) metrics. Because the preliminary study analyzed only 90 projects and the 90 projects are not representative of GitHub, this paper extend the preliminary study to better understand the generalizability of the results by analyzing 16, 552 projects of GitHub. Furthermore, we also add a pilot study to investigate the typical duration between releases to find more appropriate release duration. The study results show that (1) approximately 23\% of developers remain in the same projects that the developers contribute to, (2) the larger projects are likely to attract and retain more developers, (3) 53\% of terminal projects eventually decay to a state of fewer than ten developers and (4) 55\% of attractive projects remain in an attractive category.},
