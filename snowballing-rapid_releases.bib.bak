  abstract   = {Many software companies are shifting from the traditional multi-month release cycle to shorter release cycles. For example, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox release new versions every 6 weeks. These shorter release cycles reduce the users' waiting time for a new release and offer better feedback and marketing opportunities to companies, but it is unclear if the quality of the software product improves as well, since developers and testers are under more pressure. In this paper, we extend our previous empirical study of Mozilla Firefox on the impact of rapid releases on quality assurance with feedback by Mozilla project members. The study compares crash rates, median uptime, and the proportion of pre- and post-release bugs in traditional releases with those in rapid releases, and we also analyze the source code changes made by developers to identify potential changes in the development process. We found that (1) with shorter release cycles, users do not experience significantly more pre- or post-release bugs (percentage-wise) and (2) bugs are fixed faster, yet (3) users experience these bugs earlier during software execution (the program crashes earlier). Increased integration activity and propagation of harder bugs to later versions account for some of these findings. Overall, our case study suggests that a clear release engineering process with thorough automation is one of the major challenges when switching to rapid releases.},

  abstract   = {Context and Motivation: Rapid software development (RSD) refers to the organizational capability to develop, release, and learn from software in rapid cycles without compromising its quality. To achieve RSD, it is essential to understand and manage software quality along the software lifecycle. Question/Problem: Despite the numerous information sources related to product quality, there is a lack of mechanisms for supporting continuous quality management throughout the whole RSD process. Principal ideas/Results: We propose Q-Rapids, a data-driven, quality-aware RSD framework in which quality and functional requirements are managed together. Quality requirements are incrementally elicited and refined based on data gathered at both development time and runtime. Project, development, and runtime data is aggregated into quality-related indicators to support decision makers in steering future development cycles. Contributions: Q-Rapids aims to increase software quality through continuous data gathering and analysis, as well as continuous management of quality requirements.},

  abstract   = {Software engineering practices strongly affect the security of the code produced. The increasingly popular Rapid Release Cycle (RRC) development methodology and easy network software distribution have enabled rapid feature introduction. RRC's defining characteristic of frequent software revisions would seem to conflict with traditional software engineering wisdom regarding code maturity, reliability and reuse, as well as security. Our investigation of the consequences of rapid release comprises a quantitative, data-driven study of the impact of rapid-release methodology on the security of the Mozilla Firefox browser. We correlate reported vulnerabilities in multiple rapid release versions of Firefox code against those in corresponding extended release versions of the same system; using a common software base with different release cycles eliminates many causes other than RRC for the observables. Surprisingly, the resulting data show that Firefox RRC does not result in higher vulnerability rates and, further, that it is exactly the unfamiliar, newly released software (the "moving targets") that requires time to exploit. These provocative results suggest that a rethinking of the consequences of software engineering practices for security may be warranted.},

Furthermore, rapid releases make testing more continuous and have proportionally smaller spikes before the main release.

In addition, our semi-systematic literature review presents the benefits, problems and enablers of rapid releases from 24 papers found using systematic search queries and a similar amount of papers found through other means. The literature review shows that rapid releases are a prevalent industrial practice that are utilized even in some highly critical domains of software engineering, and that rapid releases originated from several software development methodologies such as agile, open source, lean and internet-speed software development. However, empirical studies proving evidence of the claimed advantages and disadvantages of rapid releases are scarce.},

To better understand the impact that rapid release cycles have on the integration delay of addressed issues, we perform a comparative study of traditional and rapid release cycles. Through an empirical study of 72,114 issue reports from the Firefox system, we observe that, surprisingly, addressed issues take a median of 50 days longer to be integrated in rapid Firefox releases than the traditional ones. To investigate the factors that are related to integration delay in traditional and rapid release cycles, we train regression models that explain if an addressed issue will have its integration delayed or not. Our explanatory models achieve good discrimination (ROC areas of 0.81-0.83) and calibration scores (Brier scores of 0.05-0.16). Deeper analysis of our explanatory models indicates that traditional releases prioritize the integration of backlog issues, while rapid releases prioritize issues that were addressed during the current release cycle. Our results suggest that rapid release cycles may not be a silver bullet for the rapid delivery of addressed issues to users.},

  abstract  = {Test case prioritization is one of the most practically useful activities in testing, specially for large scale systems. The goal is ranking the existing test cases in a way that they detect faults as soon as possible, so that any partial execution of the test suite detects maximum number of defects for the given budget. Test prioritization becomes even more important when the test execution is time consuming, e.g., manual system tests vs. automated unit tests. Most existing test case prioritization techniques are based on code coverage, which requires access to source code. However, manual testing is mainly done in a black- box manner (manual testers do not have access to the source code). Therefore, in this paper, we first examine the existing test case prioritization techniques and modify them to be applicable on manual black-box system testing. We specifically study a coverage- based, a diversity-based, and a risk driven approach for test case prioritization. Our empirical study on four older releases of Mozilla Firefox shows that none of the techniques are strongly dominating the others in all releases. However, when we study nine more recent releases of Firefox, where the development has been moved from a traditional to a more agile and rapid release environment, we see a very signifiant difference (on average 65\% effectiveness improvement) between the risk-driven approach and its alternatives. Our conclusion, based on one case study of 13 releases of an industrial system, is that test suites in rapid release environments, potentially, can be very effectively prioritized for execution, based on their historical riskiness; whereas the same conclusions do not hold in the traditional software development environments.},

To better understand the impact that rapid release cycles have on the integration delay of fixed issues, we perform a comparative study of traditional and rapid release cycles. Our comparative study has two parts: (i) a quantitative empirical analysis of 72,114 issue reports from the Firefox project, and a (ii) qualitative study involving 37 participants, who are contributors of the Firefox, Eclipse, and ArgoUML projects. Our study is divided into quantitative and qualitative analyses. Quantitative analyses reveal that, surprisingly, fixed issues take a median of 54\% (57 days) longer to be integrated in rapid Firefox releases than the traditional ones. To investigate the factors that are related to integration delay in traditional and rapid release cycles, we train regression models that model whether a fixed issue will have its integration delayed or not.

Our explanatory models indicate that (i) traditional releases prioritize the integration of backlog issues, while (ii) rapid releases prioritize issues that were fixed in the current release cycle. Complementary qualitative analyses reveal that participants' perception about integration delay is tightly related to activities that involve decision making, risk management, and team collaboration. Moreover, the allure of shipping fixed issues faster is a main motivator for adopting rapid release cycles among participants (although this motivation is not supported by our quantitative analysis). Furthermore, to explain why traditional releases deliver fixed issues more quickly, our participants point out the rush for integration in traditional releases and the increased time that is invested on polishing issues in rapid releases. Our results suggest that rapid release cycles may not be a silver bullet for the rapid delivery of new content to users.

Goal: This paper examines step by step the release process of an industrial software organization aiming to identify factors that have a significant impact on the lead time and outcomes of the software releases. Method: Over 14 months of release data have been analyzed (246 releases from the isolated source code branches to the production environment). Results: We discuss three dimensions under which a series of factors could be addressed: technical, organizational, and interactional. We present our findings in terms of implications for release process improvements.

Because this approach reduces time for testing, it raises concerns about the effectiveness of quality assurance in this setting. In this paper, we study how the adoption of rapid release cycles impacts bug reopening rate, an indicator for the quality of the bug fixing process. To this end, we analyze thousands of bug reports from Mozilla Firefox, both before and after their adoption of rapid releases. Results suggest that the bug reopening rate of versions developed in rapid cycles was about 7\% higher. Also, as a warning to the software analytics community, we report contradictory results from three attempts to answer our research question, performed with varying degrees of knowledge about the Firefox release process.},

This requires not only agile processes in teams but in the complete research and development organization. Additionally, the technology used in the different development phases, like requirements engineering and system integration, must support the quick development cycles. Finally, automatic live experimentation for different system alternatives enables fast gathering of required data for decision making. The workshop, the second in the series after the first one at ICSE 2014, aims to bring the research communities of the aforementioned areas together to exchange challenges, ideas, and solutions to bring software engineering a step further to being a holistic continuous process. The workshop program is based on eight papers selected in the peer-review process and supplemented by interaction and discussions at the workshop. The topics range from agile methods, continuous software engineering practices to specific techniques, like visualization and testing.},

  abstract   = {Test case prioritization is an important testing activity, in practice, specially for large scale systems. The goal is to rank the existing test cases in a way that they detect faults as soon as possible, so that any partial execution of the test suite detects the maximum number of defects for the given budget. Test prioritization becomes even more important when the test execution is time consuming, for example, manual system tests versus automated unit tests. Most existing test case prioritization techniques are based on code coverage, which requires access to source code. However, manual testing is mainly performed in a black-box manner (manual testers do not have access to the source code). Therefore, in this paper, the existing test case prioritization techniques (e.g. diversity-based and history-based techniques) are examined and modified to be applicable on manual black-box system testing. An empirical study on four older releases of desktop Firefox showed that none of the techniques were strongly dominating the others in all releases. However, when nine more recent releases of desktop Firefox, where the development has been moved from a traditional to a more agile and rapid release environment, were studied, a very significant difference between the history-based approach and its alternatives was observed. The higher effectiveness of the history-based approach compared with alternatives also held on 28 additional rapid releases of other Firefox projects \textendash{} mobile Firefox and tablet Firefox. The conclusion of the paper is that test cases in rapid release environments can be very effectively prioritized for execution, based on their historical failure knowledge. In particular, it is the recency of historical knowledge that explains its effectiveness in rapid release environments rather than other changes in the process.

  abstract  = {Context Agile release engineering (ARE) practices are designed to deliver software faster and cheaper to end users; hence, claims of such impacts should be validated by rigorous and relevant empirical studies. Objective The study objective was to analyze both direct and indirect impacts of ARE practices as well as to determine how they have been empirically studied. Method The study applied the systematic literature review research method. ARE practices were identified in empirical studies by searching articles for ``rapid release,'' ``continuous integration,'' ``continuous delivery,'' and ``continuous deployment.'' We systematically analyzed 619 articles and selected 71 primary studies for deeper investigation. The impacts of ARE practices were analyzed from three viewpoints: impacts associated with adoption of the practice, prevalence of the practice, and success of software development. Results The results indicated that ARE practices can create shorter lead times and better communication within and between development teams. However, challenges and drawbacks were also found in change management, software quality assurance, and stakeholder acceptance. The analysis revealed that 33 out of 71 primary studies were casual experience reports that had neither an explicit research method nor a data collection approach specified, and 23 out of 38 empirical studies applied qualitative methods, such as interviews, among practitioners. Additionally, 12 studies applied quantitative methods, such as mining of software repositories. Only three empirical studies combined these research approaches. Conclusion ARE practices can contribute to improved efficiency of the development process. Moreover, release stakeholders can develop a better understanding of the software project's status. Future empirical studies should consider the comprehensive reporting of the context and how the practice is implemented instead of merely referring to usage of the practice. In addition, different stakeholder points of view, such as customer perceptions regarding ARE practices, still clearly require further research.},

  abstract  = {The steadily increasing popularity of computer games has led to the rise of a multi-billion dollar industry. This increasing popularity is partly enabled by online digital distribution platforms for games, such as Steam. These platforms offer an insight into the development and test processes of game developers. In particular, we can extract the update cycle of a game and study what makes developers deviate from that cycle by releasing so-called urgent updates. An urgent update is a software update that fixes problems that are deemed critical enough to not be left unfixed until a regular-cycle update. Urgent updates are made in a state of emergency and outside the regular development and test timelines which causes unnecessary stress on the development team. Hence, avoiding the need for an urgent update is important for game developers. We define urgent updates as 0-day updates (updates that are released on the same day), updates that are released faster than the regular cycle, or self-admitted hotfixes. We conduct an empirical study of the urgent updates of the 50 most popular games from Steam, the dominant digital game delivery platform. As urgent updates are reflections of mistakes in the development and test processes, a better understanding of urgent updates can in turn stimulate the improvement of these processes, and eventually save resources for game developers. In this paper, we argue that the update strategy that is chosen by a game developer affects the number of urgent updates that are released. Although the choice of update strategy does not appear to have an impact on the percentage of updates that are released faster than the regular cycle or self-admitted hotfixes, games that use a frequent update strategy tend to have a higher proportion of 0-day updates than games that use a traditional update strategy.},

To inform future approaches for automatic stress and overload detection, this paper establishes empirically collected measures of the work patterns of software engineers. To this aim, we perform the first large-scale study of software engineers' working hours by investigating the time stamps of commit activities of 86 large open source software projects, both containing hired and volunteer developers. We find that two thirds of software engineers mainly follow typical office hours, empirically established to be from 10h to 18h, and do not usually work during nights and weekends. Large variations between projects and individuals exist. Surprisingly, we found no support that project maturation would decrease abnormal working hours. In the Firefox case study, we found that hired developers work more during office hours while seniority, either in terms of number of commits or job status, did not impact working hours. We conclude that the use of working hours or timestamps of work products for stress detection requires establishing baselines at the level of individuals.},

For the survival of OSS projects, the projects need to not only retain existing developers, but also attract new developers to grow. To better understand how projects retain and attract contributors, our preliminary study aimed to measure the personnel attraction and retention of OSS projects using a pair of population migration metrics, called Magnet (personnel attraction) and Sticky (retention) metrics. Because the preliminary study analyzed only 90 projects and the 90 projects are not representative of GitHub, this paper extend the preliminary study to better understand the generalizability of the results by analyzing 16, 552 projects of GitHub. Furthermore, we also add a pilot study to investigate the typical duration between releases to find more appropriate release duration. The study results show that (1) approximately 23\% of developers remain in the same projects that the developers contribute to, (2) the larger projects are likely to attract and retain more developers, (3) 53\% of terminal projects eventually decay to a state of fewer than ten developers and (4) 55\% of attractive projects remain in an attractive category.},

  abstract   = {Continuous Integration (CI) is a software engineering practice where developers constantly integrate their changes to a project through an automated build process. The goal of CI is to provide developers with prompt feedback on several quality dimensions after each change. Indeed, previous studies provided empirical evidence on a positive association between properly following CI principles and source code quality. A core principle behind CI is Continuous Code Quality (also known as CCQ, which includes automated testing and automated code inspection) may appear simple and effective, yet we know little about its practical adoption. In this paper, we propose a preliminary empirical investigation aimed at understanding how rigorously practitioners follow CCQ. Our study reveals a strong dichotomy between theory and practice: developers do not perform continuous inspection but rather control for quality only at the end of a sprint and most of the times only on the release branch.

This paper is a preliminary step toward an analysis of the work patterns and possible indicators of overload and time pressure on software developers with mining software repositories approach. We explore the working pattern of developers in the context of Mozilla Firefox, a large and long-lived open source project. To that end we investigate the impact of the move from traditional to rapid release cycle on work pattern. Moreover we compare Mozilla Firefox work pattern with another Mozilla product, Firefox OS, which has a different release cycle than Firefox. We find that both projects exhibit healthy working patterns, i.e. lower activity during the weekends and outside of office hours. Firefox experiences proportionally more activity on weekends than Firefox OS (Cohen's d = 0.94). We find that switching to rapid releases has reduced weekend work (Cohen's d = 1.43) and working during the night (Cohen's d = 0.45). This result holds even when we limit the analyzes on the hired resources, i.e. considering only individuals with Mozilla foundation email address, although, the effect sizes are smaller for weekends (Cohen's d = 0.64) and nights (Cohen's d = 0.23). Moreover, we use dissimilarity word clouds and find that work during the weekend is more technical while work during the week expresses more positive sentiment with words like "good" and "nice". Our results suggest that moving to rapid releases have positive impact on the work health and work-life-balance of software engineers. However, caution is needed as our results are based on a limited set of quantitative data from a single organization.},

  type       = {Thesis},
  abstract   = {Releasing software is challenging. To decide when to release software, developers may  consider a deadline, a set of features or quality attributes. Yet, there are many stories of  software that is not released on time. In large-scale software development, release management  requires significant communication and coordination. It is particularly challenging  in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) ecosystems, in which hundreds of loosely connected  developers and their projects are coordinated for releasing software according to a  schedule.  In this work, we investigate the release management process in two large-scale FOSS  development projects. In particular, our focus is the communication in the whole release  management process in each ecosystem across multiple releases. The main research questions  addressed in this dissertation are: (1) How do developers in these FOSS ecosystems  communicate and coordinate to build and release a common product based on different  projects? (2) What are the release management tasks in a FOSS ecosystem? and (3) What  are the challenges that release managers face in a FOSS ecosystem?  To understand this process and its challenges better, we used a multiple case study  methodology, and colleced evidence from a combination of the following sources: documents,  archival records, interviews, direct observation, participant observation, and physical  artifacts. We conducted the case studies on two FLOSS software ecosystems: GNOME  and OpenStack. We analyzed over two and half years of communication in each ecosystem  and studied developers' interactions. GNOME is a collection of libraries, system services,  and end-user applications; together, these projects provide a unified desktop \textemdash the GNOME  desktop. OpenStack is a collection of software tools for building and managing cloud computing  platforms for public and private clouds. We catalogued communication channels,  categorized coordination activities in one channel, and triangulated our results by  interviewing key developers identified through social network analysis.  We found factors that impact the release process in a software ecosystem, including a  release schedule positively, influence instead of direct control, and diversity. The release  schedule drives most of the communication within an ecosystem. To achieve a concerted release,  a Release Team helps developers reach technical consensus through influence rather  than direct control. The diverse composition of the Release Team might increase its reach  and influence in the ecosystem. Our results can help organizations build better large-scale  teams and show that software engineering research focused on individual projects might  miss important parts of the picture.  The contributions of this dissertation are: (1) an empirical study of release management  in two FOSS ecosystems (2) a set of lessons learned from the case studies, and (3) a theory  of release management in FOSS ecosystems. We summarize our theory that explains our  understanding of release management in FOSS ecosystems as three statements: (1) the size  and complexity of the integrated product is constrained by the release managers capacity,  (2) release management should be capable of reaching the whole ecosystem, and (3) the  release managers need social and technical skills. The dissertation discusses this theory in  the light of the case studies, other research efforts, and its implications.},

  abstract  = {In rapid release development processes, patches that fix critical issues, or implement high-value features are often promoted directly from the development channel to a stabilization channel, potentially skipping one or more stabilization channels. This practice is called patch uplift. Patch uplift is risky, because patches that are rushed through the stabilization phase can end up introducing regressions in the code. This paper examines patch uplift operations at Mozilla, with the aim to identify the characteristics of the uplifted patches that did not effectively fix the targeted problem and that introduced regressions. Through statistical and manual analyses, a series of problems were investigated, including the reasons behind patch uplift decisions, the root causes of ineffective uplifts, the characteristics of uplifted patches that introduced regressions, and whether these regressions can be prevented. Additionally, three Mozilla release managers were interviewed in order to understand organizational factors that affect patch uplift decisions and outcomes. Results show that most patches are uplifted because of a wrong functionality or a crash. Certain uplifts did not effectively address their problems because they did not completely fix the problems or lead to regressions. Uplifted patches that lead to regressions tend to have larger patch size, and most of the faults are due to semantic or memory errors in the patches. Also, release managers are more inclined to accept patch uplift requests that concern certain specific components, and\textendash or that are submitted by certain specific developers. About 25\% to 30\% of the regressions due to Beta or Release uplifts could have been prevented as they could be reproduced by developers and were found in widely used feature/website/configuration or via telemetry.},

This paper presents an exploratory case study of rapid releases at ING, a large banking company that develops software solutions in-house, to characterize rapid releases. Since 2011, ING has shifted to a rapid release model. This switch has resulted in a mixed environment of 611 teams releasing relatively fast and slow. We followed a mixed-methods approach in which we conducted a survey with 461 participants and corroborated their perceptions with 2 years of code quality data and 1 year of release delay data. Our research shows that: rapid releases are more commonly delayed than their non-rapid counterparts, however, rapid releases have shorter delays; rapid releases can be beneficial in terms of reviewing and user-perceived quality; rapidly released software tends to have a higher code churn, a higher test coverage and a lower average complexity; challenges in rapid releases are related to managing dependencies and certain code aspects, e.g., design debt.},

The strategy of the release processes and practices can impact the quality of a software artefact. Although such impact has been extensively discussed and studied in the software engineering community, there are still many pending issues to resolve. The goal of this thesis is to study and solve some of these pending issues. More specifically, we examine 1) why code review practices can miss crash-prone code; 2) how urgent patches (also called patch uplift) are approved to release and how to prevent regressions due to urgent patches; 3) in a software ecosystem, how to mitigate the risk of defects due to DLL injections. We chose to study these problems because they correspond to three important phases of software release processes, i.e., code review, patch uplift, and releasing software in an ecosystem. The solutions of these problems can help software organizations improve their release strategy; increasing their development productivity and the overall user-perceived quality of their products.},

  abstract   = {Developing a successful game is challenging. Prior work shows that gamers are extremely difficult to satisfy, making the quality of games an important issue. Prior work has yielded important results from mining data that is available on the online distribution platforms for software applications, helping practitioners save valuable resources, and improving the user-perceived quality of software that is distributed through these platforms. However, much of the work on mining online distribution platforms focuses on mining mobile app stores (e.g., Google Play Store, Apple App Store). Video game development differs from the development of other types of software. Hence, knowledge derived from mining mobile app stores may not be directly applicable to game development.    In this Ph.D. thesis, we focused on mining online distribution platforms for games. In particular, we mined data from the Steam platform, the largest digital distribution platforms for PC gaming, with over 23,000 games available and over 184 million active users. More specifically, we analyzed the following four aspects of online distribution for games: urgent updates; the early access model (which enables game developers to sell unfinished versions of their games); user reviews; and user-recorded gameplay videos on the Steam platform. We observed that the choice of update strategy is associated with the proportion of urgent updates that developers have to release. Early access game developers can use the early access model as a method for eliciting early feedback and more positive reviews to attract additional new players. In addition, although negative reviews contain more valuable information for developers, the portion of useful information in positive reviews should not be ignored by developers and researchers. Finally, we proposed an approach for determining the likelihood that a gameplay video demonstrates a game bug, with both a mean average precision at 10 and a mean average precision at 100 of 0.91. Our approach can help game developers leverage readily available gameplay videos to automatically collect otherwise hard-to-gather bug reports for games. The results of our empirical studies highlight the value of mining online distribution platforms for games in offering practical suggestions for game developers.},

It has been observed that many Open Source projects follow agile practices of parallel development and Rapid Releases (RR) but, very few studies till date, have analyzed release patterns of these Open Source projects. This paper analyzes ten Open Source Java projects (Apache Server Foundation) comprising 718 releases to study the evolution of release lengths. The results of the study show that: (1) eight out of ten datasets followed RR models. (2) None of these datasets followed RR models since their first release. (3) The average release length was found to be four months for major versions and one month for minor versions (exceptions removed). (4) There exists a negative correlation between number of contributors and release length.},

I found that despite using rapid release, the Chrome and Linux projects still have a period where they rush changes into a release. Second, developers typically isolate unrelated changes on branches. However, developers at major companies, such as Google and Facebook, commit all changes to a single branch. They isolate unrelated changes using feature-flags, which allows them to disable works in progress. My goal is to empirically determine the best practices when using flags and identify dead code. Finally, I will develop tool support to manage feature flags.},

  abstract  = {Large open source software projects, like Eclipse, follow a continuous software development process, with a regular release cycle. During each release, new bugs are reported, triaged and resolved. Previous studies have focused on various aspects of bug fixing, such as bug triaging, bug prediction, and bug process analysis. Most studies, however, do not distinguish between what happens before and after each scheduled release. We are also unaware of studies that compare bug fixing activities across different project releases. This paper presents an empirical analysis of the bug handling process of Eclipse over a 15-year period, considering 138K bug reports from Bugzilla, including 16 annual Eclipse releases and two quarterly releases in 2018. We compare the bug resolution rate, the fixing rate, the bug triaging time and the fixing time before and after each release date, and we study the possible impact of "release pressure". Among others, our results reveal that Eclipse bug handling activity is improving over time, with an important decrease in the number of reported bugs before releases, an increase in the bug fixing rate and an increasingly balanced bug handling workload before and after releases. The recent transition from an annual to a quarterly release cycle continued to improve the bug handling process.},
